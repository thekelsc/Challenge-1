 - In this exercise I updated the html tags to reflect the appropriate tags for the different sections of code (ex:div was transitioned for more specific tags such as: header/footer/section/)
 - I also added updated the navigation links to fire correctly. 
 - I updated html and css file commentary to indicate appropriate code activitities. 
 - I confirmed connectivity with github, and published changes as file was modified (after initial challenges with git-main changeover from run-buddy exercise). 
 - I updated Alt text for page accessiblity. 
 - I updated CSS code to reflect logic that applied to multiple segments. 
 - I created a markdown file, confirmed file loads on github webpage.
